## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Navy Blue (#000080) to convey sophistication and expertise in technology. 
- Background color: Light Gray (#F5F5F5) to ensure readability and a clean, modern look.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) as a highlight color that complements the navy blue, offering a subtle and professional contrast.
- Body text and Headlines: 'Roboto', a grotesque-style sans-serif, suitable for both headlines and body text, to maintain a modern, machined, objective, neutral look. This single font is suitable given that most portfolio apps contain relatively little body text.
- Use a consistent set of minimalist icons to represent different services and skills.
- Employ a grid-based layout for a structured and responsive design, ensuring optimal viewing on all devices.
- Use subtle fade-in animations on project elements to create a smooth user experience.
